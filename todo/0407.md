Feedback: 
- I want to separate my speaking / generative abilities, and my "being able to express an idea" abilities. Better.

I generally would rather have fleuncy over a predefined list of things that somebody might say than try to use this app to grind out a few new flashcards a day. It generally seems to be going so slow. 

Other ideas: instead of overfitting, I want special flashcards which test the skill that I'm obviously missing
